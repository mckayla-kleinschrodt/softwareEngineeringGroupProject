Welcome to Breakthrough! 

This game is largely based on the logic of old school arcade games -- pong, and breakaway.
This game was created to allow for a retro gaming experience that can be played alone or with frineds. 

The game.py file is the main file that should be run, and calls in the abstracted classes Paddle, Ball, and Bricks. 

In the future this game could include different levls, and be put on a server to support high scores to create a player community.

TO PLAY:
Run game.py file, enter information in prompt boxes on main screen. Single player is played with arrows, multi-player is played with arrows and W + S keys
For single player, the amount of live chosen is the number of times the ball can hit the wall that is directly behind the paddle. 
For Multi-playerm, the amount of lives entered is multiplied into second and the person with the most bricks gone at the end of the time is the winner!
If there is an error in entereing, the error will be shown in the console, and will instruct the user on how to change their information

HAVE FUN GAMING!
